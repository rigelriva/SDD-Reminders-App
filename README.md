# Remindify Software Design Development Program

## How to install and view the code
You can download this by downloading the zip file by pressing the **GREEN "CODE"** button and pressing **"Download ZIP"** or  you click each file and download the individual raw files individually via the right-hand side download button.

### Extensions
* Prettier - Code formatter v10.4.0

These are accessed and installed through the sidebar on the left of Visual Studio and go to 'Extensions' (or Ctrl + Shift + X).

**NOTE: Please note that the notification system of the program doesn't work consistently when it's run through Visual Studio Code. Rather, when you wish to view the code at its full functionality open this link in the [Verscel App](https://sdd-reminders-app-dgo7.vercel.app/).**

When you want to see the Reminders App Program to function, keep the Vercel App link running in the background in your tabs and make sure to **_allow notifications_** when opening up the app as well as **_enabling notifications for chrome_ (or what other web browser you're using)** within your computer device. 
* When you want to view the code, it's suggested you view it in VSC with the _Prettier Extension_
